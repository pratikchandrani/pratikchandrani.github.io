<p>
    I am currently an Assistant Professor and Independent Group Leader at
    <a href="https://tmc.gov.in/">Tata Memorial Centre</a>, Navi Mumbai, India,
    where I head the Computational Biology, Bioinformatics & Crosstalk Lab.

<p class="text-center font-weight-bold">Comprehensive Genomic Profiling and Cancer Genomics Research</p>

<p>
    My research focuses on cancer genomics, computational biology, and therapeutic applications. I lead a
    comprehensive genomic profiling project of solid tumors in collaboration with 4baseCare (Bengaluru, India)
    and Illumina (California, USA), having completed sequencing of 1500 whole exome and transcriptome samples.
    I have established a novel hypothesis on microchromosome-mediated oncogenesis and initiated experimental
    validation efforts.
</p>

<p>
    I have secured competitive funding from DST-SERC and DBT (Government of India) as PI and co-PI for multiple
    projects. My research has established national and international collaborations with institutions including
    the National Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Michigan, National Institute of Research in
    Reproductive Health, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), and Flinders
    University.
</p>

<p>
    During my PhD at ACTREC (2011-2017) under <a href="https://www.amitduttlab.com/">Dr. Amit Dutt</a>, I made key contributions including: (1) discovery
    and characterization of novel oncogene FGFR3 in lung adenocarcinoma, (2) development of integrative genomics
    approaches for small sample sizes, and (3) creation of HPVDetector, a computational tool for analyzing HPV
    infection and integration. I also developed ClinOme during my postdoctoral research, a computational tool
    for therapeutic inference from cancer genomics data that has been licensed to a commercial entity, and played
    a pivotal role in establishing a Molecular Tumor Board at Tata Memorial Centre.
