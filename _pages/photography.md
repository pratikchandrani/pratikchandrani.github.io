<p class="mb-5">
  I have been keen on photography since 2017.
  I mostly take pictures of the scences in front of my eyes! It mostly includes wilflife, landscape, streets, light experiments, portraits and, astronomical objects.
  
  A few of my pictures can be found on
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pratikchandrani/">Instagram</a>.
  Here are some of my favorite shots.

  <p class="font-weight-bold mb-5">
    {{ picture.title }}. {{ picture.location }} ({{ picture.year}})
